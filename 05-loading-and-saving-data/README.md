# loading and saving data

this is the tutorial for loading and saving data. we needed a server side technology for this one so I decided to use `express` and `node.js`. no particular reason other than this would be the fastest thing for me.

# installation

1. install [npm][1]
2. clone this repo and cd into it
3. `npm install`

# usage

`node server.js 8080` where 8080 represents the port
